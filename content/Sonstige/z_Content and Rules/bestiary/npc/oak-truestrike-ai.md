# [Oak Truestrike](Sonstige/z_Content%20and%20Rules/bestiary/npc/oak-truestrike-ai.md)
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 205*  

Oak Truestrike is the "B" Team's decisionist-and, depending on who you talk to, a reincarnated demigod. (It's a long story.) Those who know him acknowledge his confidence, his arrogance, and his odd ability to engage with others by somehow saying exactly what each listener wants to hear. Whether this is some subtle magical ability or simply grifter's charm, he makes good use of it either way.

Oak becomes a radically different person with each of his reincarnations, flipping between neutral good and neutral evil. His memories of past lives have been fractured by his many deaths, but he spends each new life accounting for the previous life in a karmic-ledger kind of way. His current incarnation embraces the good side. Mostly. Except for that occasional toxic bitterness. Oh, and the misanthropy. Actually, if you end up hating this guy, it's probably not your fault.
