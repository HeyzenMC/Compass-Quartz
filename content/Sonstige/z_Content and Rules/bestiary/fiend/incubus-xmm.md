## Incubus

*Life-Leeching Dream Stalker*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Lower Planes)  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Incubi exploit the vulnerability of mortal dreams. Slipping into the homes of sleepers, incubi feed off dreams and replace them with terrifying nightmares. Incubi visit victims nightly until their prey expires. The incubi then hunt for new victims, preferring the loved ones of past targets.

Incubi can transform into succubi and vice versa, taking the forms they need to manipulate foes in dreams or in the flesh.

Those visited by an incubus have recurring nightmares. Roll on or choose a result from the Incubus Nightmares table to inspire these night terrors.
