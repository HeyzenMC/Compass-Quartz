# [False Lich](Sonstige/z_Content%20and%20Rules/bestiary/undead/false-lich-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 220*  

Occasionally, liches create nefarious magical copies of themselves to fool enemies, to guard treasure, or for other inscrutable reasons.

To create a false lich, a lich binds a shred of its life force to a corpse in a profane ritual. This transforms the corpse into a near-identical copy of the lich with immense necrotic power and some of its creator's arcane prowess. The creator then embeds enchanted gemstones into the corpse's eye sockets; the gems allow the false lich to trap creatures' souls and transfer the souls to its creator.

A false lich often gradually gains a sense of self-identity. While many false liches remain steadfastly loyal to their creators, others resent their creators for imprisoning and abandoning them.
